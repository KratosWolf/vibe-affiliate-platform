## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo fork username/my-nextjs-app --clone
   ```

2. **Set up your development environment**
   ```bash
   cd my-nextjs-app
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

3. **Create a branch for your feature**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Process

### 1. Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test additions or fixes
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

### 2. Commit Message Format

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```bash
feat(auth): add social login with Google
fix(api): handle null response in user endpoint
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

### 3. Code Review Process

1. All code must be reviewed before merging
2. At least one approval is required
3. All CI checks must pass
4. No merge conflicts allowed

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/JavaScript

- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use functional components for React
- Prefer async/await over promises

### CSS/Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS classes

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functions
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names

```typescript
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create a new user with valid data', async () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints
- Test database operations
- Test third-party integrations

### E2E Tests

- Test critical user flows
- Test across different browsers
- Test responsive design

## Documentation

- Include examples in documentation

```typescript
/**

 * @param discount - Discount percentage (0-100)
 * @returns Discounted price
 * @example
 * calculateDiscount(100, 20) // Returns 80

}
```
